        <h3>Motivation</h3>
        <h5>Looking through the pleasure, passion, purpose lense.</h3>
          <p>Mr Meng has great insights into finding motivation at work and that is to find your higher purpose. Most people spend their lives chasing pleasure (think rockstar, shortlived highs.) Beyond this they spend a little time pursuing their passion and achieving flow but very seldom spend time and energy working on their higher purpose. The key difference in these three types of happiness are their sustainability. Pleasure is shortlived whereas working towards a higher purpose is the most sustainable form of happiness. In order to find out what motivates us in our work it then makes sense to look for our higher purpose. Because when this happens, our work can be a susatainable source of happiness! And when we are happy doing that work, we get better at it, reaching great flow in our passion. And when you get good at your work, you then get recognition for that work which is the rockstar happiness that is shortlived but relished in small doses. </p>

          <h3>What are your core values and what do you stand for?</h3>
          <p>In practicing Meditation and Mindfullness we can improve our self awareness which inturn builds our alignement. </p>
          <p>I value:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Kindess. Because kindness is cool and the world is tough enough. Sometimes acts of kindess can make all the differnece.</li>
            <li>Innovation and using technoligy for social change</li>
            <li>Integrity and grit</li>
            <li>Happiness and the flow that comes from this. I also value the small life pleasures that are everywhere and anywhere</li>
            <li>Creativity, progress and continual improvement</li>

          <h3>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</h3>
          <p>With alignment and envisioning we can figure out where we want to go. With resilience, we can get through the tough times to get there.</p>

          <p>With this meditative excercise I was reminded once more that my emotions are not me and that my inner strength is still as strong as ever. I've thought of myself as resilient, tencaious and strong and with a meditation this reminded me that they are still a core part of me.In order to success we all must fail and fail a lot if your exploring new innovative ideas. This new career path of Web Dev aligns with my core values and in order to succeed Im going to feel stupid along the way. This is especially true as technology is constantly changing and so the general rule is if your not out of your depth, your out of date. This success and failure in innovation is nicely summarised in the following quote from Search Inside Yourself.</p>

          <p class="quote">“Lewis and Clark were lost most of the time. If your idea of exploration is to always know where you are and to be inside your zone of competence, you don’t do wild new shit. You have to be confused, upset, think you’re stupid. If you’re not willing to do that, you can’t go outside the box.”
