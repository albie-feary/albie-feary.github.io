    <p>
      HELLO and welcome to my home page!
    <p>
      It is an absolute pleasure to have you here!
    <p>
      Over the next 18 weeks i'll be blogging my progress right here on this very site. I will go from knowing next to zilch in programming and eventually emerge out the other end with the skills to be a world class junior web developer!
    <p>
      If you have any comments, advice, wisdom or magic for the website (or anything really) PLEASE get in contact with me!
    <p>
      Thats all from me for now, enjoy and peace.
