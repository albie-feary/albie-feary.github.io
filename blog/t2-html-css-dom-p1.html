  <h2>HTML, CSS and the DOM</h2>
      <p>
        HTML is the language of the web and can be thought of as the building blocks of a website. Just like the foundations and walls of a house, it is the structure.
      <p>
        CSS is where style or desgin comes in. Using the house metaphor, it could be used to decorate the walls or add artistic features to the house. But just as you cannot place a picture on a wall without a hangar, there are rules to attach CSS styling to HTML.
        <p>
          The DOM is where HMTL is turned into a tree-like structure (in that it has branches) and so creates functionality. Think of it as the architectural plans, how everyting connnects together.
        </p>

    <h2>Boxifying Design</h2>
      <p>
        Boxifying desgin is a desgin technique of viewing a webpage and compartmentalising it. Creates for better page layout and better user experience.
      </p>

      <h2>What is the Box Model? </h2>
      <div id="Box-model">
      <img src="half-width-image.jpg" alt="Image of box model" style="width:30%">
      <p class="margin">
          The box model is a design tecnhique to breakdown space within and outside of the created boxes.The size of the element is equal to the sum of the border, padding and content of the box.
        </p>
          <br>
        <p>
          Think of it as the different CSS layers wrapped around an HMTL element.
          <ul>
            <li>The Content is what is inside the box, like text.</li>
            <li>The Padding is the space between the content and the border box.</li>
            <li>Border is the border around the box.</li>
            <li>Margin is what clears the area around the border.</li>
          </ul>
