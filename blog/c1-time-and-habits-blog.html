    <h1>Reflections on Time and Habit Techniques</h1>

    <h4>23 Feb 17</h4>

    <h5>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try? </h5>
    <p> I enjoy the Pomodoro Technique and will be implementing it. The incrimental
      approach is hugely appealling as the short burst of focus trains the brain to focus better. You are better able to track time effectively too!
      Mindfullness and mediation is an incredibly powerful technique that I am new to but
      really enjoy practicing and can utilise in all aspects of life.


    <h5>What did you find interesting?</h5>
    <p>I found the general theme of all the posts on productivity, focus and habits interesting
      in that a lot spoke of incrimental bursts of focus and energy. And to link this to physical exercise whereby
      interval training is the best for results, it therefor makes sense to treat the brain the same!
      The more I learn about meditation the more interested I am in this fascinating field.


    <h5>What worked for you?</h5>
    <p> For me, the Pomodoro technique is brilliant. Bursts of focus combined with the ability to track
      time spent on tasks. This in turn trains for better managing and estimating time required for projects.

    <h5>Which will you experiment further with?</h5>
    Meditation, Mindfullness and The Pomodoro Technique.
