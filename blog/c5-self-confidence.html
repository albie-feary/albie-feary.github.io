        <h3>Mindfulness &amp; Self Awareness</h3>
        <p>Self Awareness and Mindfullness is essentially the same thing. Both create clarity and objectively obvserve our responses in relxaed yet alert ways.

          Self awareness goes beyond our moment to moment emotional experience, rather it delves into the domain of self. The three areas of self awarenss are:
          <ul>
            <li>Emotional Awareness</li>
            <li>Accurate Self-Assessment</li>
            <li>Self-confidence</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

          <p>Mr Meng speaks of his time he spoke at a World Peace festival alongside some incredibly successful people with Nobel prizes and the likes... feeling out of his depths here he used the following mindfullness and self awarness techniques to maitain self confidence the whole time.</p><br>

          <div class = "row">
            <div class="six columns"><ul>
            <li>He treated his ego with humour</li>
            <li>He had objective thoughts on personal strength and limitations</li>
            <li>He knew his faliure mode and recovery mode methods</li>
            <li>And he maintained joyful mindfulness as much as possible</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <p>
            Mr Meng reaches sustainable self condifence by having nothing to hide, blatant self honesty and a deep self- awareness.

                <h3>Self awareness Practices</h3>
                <p> Our guru, Mr Meng suggests two practices to deepen Self Awareness. The first technique <strong>Body Scan</strong> was a powerful excercise in attention. During the practice my mind would wander and I would gently bring it back. I ended up feeling a great sense of peace and happiness which is a GREAT thing to be able to conjure. Feeling very magical really.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The second practice was <strong>Mindfulness Journalling</strong>. This produced information that was within my mind and not in clear view! This exercise let my thoughts flow onto paper and so in way, can be thought of as mindfullness of thoughts and emotions.
                  This practice is so powerfull because it has the abiltiy to surprise oneself of all that we are capable of.</p><br>
                  <p>Quoting an article that appeared on March 2, 2009, on the Very Short List (VSL): Science website:11, The stats that vouch for the practice are pretty incredible too.
                  </p>
                  <p>"Twenty years ago, University of Texas psychologist James Pennebaker concluded that <strong>students who wrote about their most meaningful personal experiences for 15 minutes a day several days in a row felt better, had healthier blood work, and got higher grades in school. But a new study from the University of Missouri shows that a few minutes of writing will also suffice.</strong>
                    Researchers asked 49 college students to take <strong>two minutes</strong> on two consecutive days and write about something they found to be emotionally significant. The participants registered immediate <strong>improvements in mood and performed better on standardized measures of physiological well-being.</strong>
                  </p>
                  <p> So YES please... I'd like to join ranks and set aside 4 minutes/day to make a measurable difference in my Self Awareness.

                    <h4>"My Emotions are Not Me"</h4>
                    <p>What a revelation! Thanks Mr Meng for revealing to me that my emotions are not me. And that with enough mindfulness practice emotions become something that you <strong>FEEL</strong> and not what you are. Mr Meng goes on to explain that with this subtle shift from "I am angry" to "I feel anger" comes the possibility of <strong>mastery of our emotions!</strong> What wizardry...</p>
