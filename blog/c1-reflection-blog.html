  <h3> What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h3>
  <p>
    The DBC/EDA experience to me is an incredibly exciting opportunity! Its an
    experience unlike any other I've ever had.
    What strikes me as so important is EDA's culture of learning whereby we are
    pushed forward to be in a 'vulnerable state' in order to accelerate learning
    and create a closer, more empathetic cohort. I like that it's incredibly
    diverse and core values of EDA is engineering with empathy, kindness and integrity.
    "You are who your surround yourslef with" is something I identify with and this
    seems to be one EDA's strengths. Take people from all walks of life, with a passion for
    tech and something magical can happen when everyone puts their best efforts in.

    <h3>What are your impressions?</h3>
    <p>
      I am incredibly impressed with how open and supportive my cohort team has been already.</p>
      <p>I am aware the workload is going to get more and more complex so it is important to keep up and understand concepts. I am however enjoying those little wins and 'aha' moments!</p>

      <h3>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h3>
      <p>
        Engaging with this kind of culture requires kindness, integrity and empathy. I also intend on engaging with this culture by speaking up when I dont understand and making full use of the resources available.</p>

        <h3>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h3>
        <p>
          Though I did loads of research on EDA, my expectations have been exceeded. My biggest expectation shift so far is that its totally ok to ask any niggly questions and not even feel silly about it
          as we are all in this together.</p>

          <h3>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h3>
          <p>
            Oh so nervous! But so very excited! Its a strange see-saw balancing act for me. What Shereef spoke of in his <a href="https://vimeo.com/85001014">Fireside Chat</a> was all so great in answering ideas around being an imposter, enduring the long race, being the right kind of smart etc etc...
