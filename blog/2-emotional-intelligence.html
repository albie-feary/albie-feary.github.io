    Mr Meng’s writing style is fun in its playfulness and yet is very much a book of science where Mindfulness and Meditation is measurable and demonstrative.
    It is evident that this will be of enormous use for life and life as a developer. I have already been seeing the benefits of such practice in helping deal with any frustrating or stressful situation that have swung my way. Serious super powers waiting to be unlocked there!

    I started out strong with incorporating meditation into my daily routine but have very much fallen out of habit with this over the past week. I’ll bring back the two minute “easy way” meditation where the idea is to just be present in your breathing and gently bring yourself back to this every time a thought enters your mind. Focusing on breathing and not thinking is such a tricky skill, one that can only really improve from here! Surely!
