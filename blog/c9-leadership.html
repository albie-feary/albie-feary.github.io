        <h3>Leadership</h3>
        <p>Mr Meng teaches us about three hefty social skills in this chapter. These are: leading with compassion, influencing with goodness and communicating with insight. </p>

          <h3>What is your experience of compassionate (or not) leadership?</h3>
          <p>Mr Meng describes compasssionate leadership as the abilty to understand, feel and help in leadership. This quality is the difference between a good leader and a great leader according to the studies made by Jim Collins in his book Good to Great.<br>
          My experience of compassionate leadership can be very strongly linked to my experience of crewing on yachts. Yachts have a strong hierachal order and the Captain is at the top. I've worked for many captains and compassion was the difference betwen the greatest captain and the other good ones. He understood the situation we were in, he empathised and was reasonable. He was incredbly open and trustworthy and he believed in us to deliver.</p>

            <h3>Do the multiplying goodness meditation. How did you find it?</h3>
            <p>This meditation practice was incredible. Honing in on the goodness of myself, others and then giving the goodness to the world is a beautiful feeling. The powerful part was transforming and multipling that goodness to everyone. By seeing the goodness in self and others, I can strengthen my ability for compassion - because we are all connected. By sending that goodness to everyone, I strengthen my motivational "I want to help you" part of compassion.</p>

            <h3>Do the Tonglen meditation. How did you find it?</h3>
            <p>Tonglen is the traditional practice for training compassion. In Tebetian this term means 'giving and receiving.' Similar to the multiplying goodness meditation it only differs in that you breath in suffering and transform it into love, kindness and compassion on your breath out. Doing this meditation, though it sounds unpleasant is incredbly powerful. I felt as though nothing could harm me becasue within me is the immense power to turn it around for goodness. It also instilled a deep sense of self confidence within me.</p>

            <h3>  How does the SCARF model apply to your Phase 0 experience so far? How will it apply to bootcamp?</h3>
            <p>Understanding the social brain allows us to identify that negative experiences affect us much more strongly than positive ones. Based on studies by psychologist Barbara Fredrickson, this is at a ratio of 3:1. For every negative experience, we require 3 positive ones to balance it out! <br><br>
              The SCARF model is a model that breaks down the areas of social experience that treats the brain with either reward of threat, positively or negatively. These are <strong>Status, Certainty, Autonomy, Relatedeness and Fairness</strong>.<br><br>
              In Phase 0 my <strong>status</strong> has been disrupted as I'm now at the bottom of the pecking order in this new and daunting (but incredibly exciting) industry. With this change of life, career &amp; study, my experience of <strong>certainty</strong> is feeling a little threatened. But this is part of the great leap into a new challenge. My experience of <strong>autonomy</strong>, however is strong and I relish in this new direction Ive launched myself into. Feeling powerful and with good direction! With the support of the hihi cohort, my experience of <strong>relatedness</strong> has been positive with open and friendly new friends going through the same learning process. <strong>Fairness</strong> is an interesting one in that humans are the only animal set to intentionally punish self-interest in order to punish the unfairness in others. My expereince of fairness in phase 0 has been positive.<br><br>
              Going into Bootcamp (and beyond really) these SCARF domains will be important in expanding influence by knowing what makes the social mind tick. Basically what it all boils down to is - treating others with goodness and serving the greater good. Nice work Mr Meng!

                <h3>Have a difficult conversation. How did it go?</h3>
                <p>Having difficult conversations is something I've been wanting to improve my abilties in. A difficult conversation can be made easier by understanding that impact is not the same as someones intention. This is important for both parties in the conversation to understand. As well as this, a person's identity is most at risk when having difficult conversations. This revolves around the questions of competence, worthiness, goodness etc. By being empathetic around these two techniques I was better able to engage in a difficult conversation while thinking about impact and intention, and come to solve the problem without hurting the idenity of the person.</p>
