        <p>This sprint I got blocked on the chessboard problem in the 'Elegant JS' task. The problem involved making an 8 by 8 grid using #.
 Feeling daunted I wrote out some pseudocode on paper to try to make sense of what was being asked of me. I knew I needed to create a while loop and I had a vague feeling of what I needed to do after the pseudocode excerise.
 After doing some rubber duckying and google searches I let the task be and moved on. Coming back to it later, with fresh eyes really helped but still I couldn't crack it. In the end I searched for the solution which was so very similar to mine! Was actually a relief to see that I was very nearly there!

        <h3>Problem solving techniques and processes</h3>
        <ul>
          <li> <strong>Pseudocode:</strong> Because this type of thinking is very new to me, writing out pseudocode is a helpful technique. I can actually feel my brain changing in its thought processes the more I delve into this new world of logic</li>
          <li> <strong>Try Something:</strong> This is something I keep telling myself when I run into a problem I dont know where to begin with. When I just try something it at least starts a chain of problem solving. When I dont try, then the process doesnt begin. This does however encourage me to just delve into the problem which I think sometimes requires more considered thought. </li>
          <li> <strong>Rubber Ducky Method:</strong> This method is something I use constantly, I find speaking outloud and explaining to myself is very effective in solving problems. </li>
          <li> <strong>Reading the error problems:</strong> Just a few weeks ago this was a scary tech situation to be in. But now reading these error messages are my life savers in deducing what is going wrong. </li>
          <li> <strong>Using the console.log:</strong> Need to improve my use of this one. </li>
          <li> <strong>Googling:</strong> Slackoverflow has been my savior, as with github resourse - re iterating re iterating... </li>
          <li> <strong>Asking your peers for help:</strong> So great being surrounded by others in the same learning boat. </li>
          <li> <strong>Asking coaches for help:</strong>Not to help speicifically just nice to know theyre there if needed.</li>
          <li> <strong>Improving your process with reflection:</strong>This is one that I need to hone in on. I often solve a problem without really knowing how and being very stoked to have got there I then quickly move onwards. Taking a moment to revise what was just done and relflect how it could have been done better would benefit hugely. </li>

        <h3>Explain to your non-tech friend the following functions </h3>
        <ul>
          <li> <strong>.map()</strong> Map will call another funtion in the array and return the result. So the original array will remain the same but the new returned array will show the mapped function. </li>
          <li> <strong>.filter()</strong> Filter passes arrays through a function. If these evaluate to true they will be included in a new arary.</li>
          <li> <strong>.reduce()</strong> Reduce allows the contents of a function to be reduced down to one element or a single string moving from left to right. </li>
        </ul>
